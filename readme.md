## Introduction

In this event, we are building an Autonomous Agent to help business stakeholders of the CPG companies to optimize their marketing spend ROI. Build an autonomous agent that can intelligently answer business questions. Key features that the agent should be able to handle:

## Key Features

Our Autonomous Agent offers the following key features:

1. **Generate Insights on the stakeholders key objective:**
   - The agent can provide valuable insights related to the stakeholders primary objectives for marketing.

2. **Task Breakdown:**
   - It can break down the stakeholder's objective into multiple tasks, categorizing them into three main buckets:
     - **Structured Data Analysis:**
       - The agent is capable of answering questions based on statistical analysis of structured data. It can provide insights from existing datasets without feeding the entire data to the LLM model.

     - **External / Unstructured Data Utilization:**
       - It can answer questions by augmenting data from external sources or by considering context from prior conversations. This allows it to tap into a wealth of external information to provide answers.

     - **ML Models Integration:**
       - For questions that require more complex analysis and predictive power, the agent can build machine learning models. It can handle tasks that demand model creation and application to provide informed responses.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/autonomous-marketing-agent.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure the agent settings by adding adding the environment variables to [Configuration](secrets.env).

4. Now the agent is ready to use.

## Usage

To use the Autonomous Marketing ROI Optimization Agent:

1. Initialize the agent with the necessary data.

2. Ask your business questions related to marketing ROI optimization.

3. The agent will intelligently analyze the questions and provide insights and answers, leveraging structured data, external sources, and machine learning models as needed.

4. Review and apply the insights to enhance your marketing strategies and improve ROI.

## Configuration

The agent's behavior and configuration can be customized to fit your specific needs. For customized configuration system prompts needs to be changed accordingly [Configuration](llm_base_prompts.py).

## Future Scope

In our roadmap for future development, we plan to introduce a "Speech-to-Text" feature to enhance the capabilities of our Autonomous Marketing ROI Optimization Agent. This feature will allow users to interact with the agent using spoken language, opening up new possibilities for seamless communication and information retrieval.
